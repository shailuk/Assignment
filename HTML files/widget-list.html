​Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has refused to rule the possibility of team captain Wayne Rooney leaving the club at the end of the season out.

Speaking ahead of United's second-leg Europa League clash with Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, Mourinho said that he wouldn't dare push the player out of the club, but could not guarantee that he will remain at Old Trafford past the end of the season.

“You’ll have to ask him," Mourinho said after being quizzed on the midfielder's future.

"I can’t guarantee that I am here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season?

"If Wayne does leave, it is not because I want him to leave, that is all I can guarantee. I will never try and push a legend of this club to another destination.

"So you have to ask him if he wants to stay at the club for the rest of his career or if he sees himself moving on. I'm happy to have him.

"I have been very open with you. I don't want him to leave."

In case you're wondering why the match will be played on Wednesday and not on Thursday, it's because UEFA has granted special dispensation to Saint-Etienne because their close neighbours Lyon are playing at home on Thursday.

Both teams were seeded in the draw, but Lyon were given priority because they finished in a higher league position last season.
